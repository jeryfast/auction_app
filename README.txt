Auction Engine Web Application
Description
The Auction Engine is a Django-based web application that allows users to create, view, and participate in auctions. The platform offers real-time bidding through WebSockets, allowing users to see updated bid prices as they are placed. The backend provides a RESTful API for interacting with auctions and bids, while Celery handles asynchronous tasks such as auction notifications. Redis is used for both real-time WebSocket communication (via Django Channels) and background task management (via Celery).

Features
User Authentication: Register, log in, and manage profiles.
Auction Management: Create auctions with a title, description, image, and starting price.
Real-Time Bidding: Users can place bids on active auctions and see real-time updates via WebSockets.
Auction Notifications: Automatically notify auction winners and creators when auctions end.
Admin Control: Manage users, auctions, and bids via Django Admin.
REST API: Full API endpoints for creating, viewing, and bidding on auctions.
Background Task Handling: Use Celery for long-running tasks, such as notifying users about auction results.
Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Docker (for containerization)
Docker Compose (to orchestrate the services)
Python 3.10+
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/jeryfast/auction_app.git
cd auction_app
2. Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables (adjust as needed):

makefile
Copy code
DEBUG=True
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost 127.0.0.1 [::1]
POSTGRES_DB=auction_db
POSTGRES_USER=auction_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=auction_password
DATABASE_URL=postgres://auction_user:auction_password@db:5432/auction_db
3. Build and Start the Project with Docker
Use Docker Compose to build and start the services (Django, Redis, PostgreSQL, and Celery):

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
4. Run Migrations
After starting the containers, run the database migrations:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
5. Create a Superuser (Admin)
Create an admin user to access Django Admin:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow the prompts to set up a superuser account.

6. Collect Static Files
bash
Copy code
docker-compose exec web python manage.py collectstatic
7. Access the Application
The Django app will be running on http://localhost:8000.
The Django Admin can be accessed at http://localhost:8000/admin/.
The WebSocket endpoint for real-time bidding is available at ws://localhost:8000/ws/auction/<auction_id>/.

Usage
Web Interface
View Auctions: Access the home page to browse active auctions, with filtering, paging, and sorting.
Create Auctions: After logging in, users can create new auctions with a title, description, image, and starting price.
Place Bids: On an auction detail page, users can place bids and see real-time updates via WebSockets.
Auction Results: Once an auction ends, the highest bidder will be notified via email (processed in the background using Celery).
API Endpoints
Get Auctions: GET /auctions/
Create Auction: POST /auctions/ (Authenticated)
Place a Bid: POST /auctions/{auction_id}/bid/ (Authenticated)
Get Bids for Auction: GET /bids/
Running Tests
Run the Django test suite with:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose exec web pytest
Background Tasks
Celery is used to handle background tasks such as notifying users when an auction ends. Ensure Celery is running in the background:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d celery
Real-Time Features
The app uses Django Channels and Redis for real-time bid updates via WebSockets. When a new bid is placed, all users viewing the auction will see the updated bid price in real-time.

Development
Create Virtual Environment (optional for non-Docker development):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run Development Server:

bash
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Technologies Used
